# Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform with Foundry

## Platform Overview

This decentralized crowdfunding platform will allow creators to launch campaigns and receive funds in cryptocurrency from backers. The platform will be built using Foundry for smart contract development and a React-based frontend.

## Core Features

### Smart Contract Features

1. **Campaign Creation**

   - Creators can start new campaigns with funding goals and deadlines
   - Multiple funding tiers with different rewards
   - Flexible funding (keep all funds) or all-or-nothing models

2. **Contributions**

   - Support for multiple cryptocurrencies (ETH + major ERC20 tokens)
   - Secure escrow of funds until campaign ends
   - Contribution tracking with rewards distribution

3. **Dispute Resolution**

   - Time-locked refunds if goals aren't met
   - DAO-style voting for disputed campaigns
   - Arbitration for failed deliveries

4. **Platform Governance**
   - Token-based governance for platform decisions
   - Fee structure (fixed % of successful campaigns)
   - Whitelisting/blacklisting of tokens

## Smart Contract Architecture

### 1. Main Factory Contract (`CrowdfundingFactory.sol`)

- Creates and manages all campaign contracts
- Tracks platform statistics
- Handles platform fees

### 2. Campaign Contract (`CrowdfundingCampaign.sol`)

- Manages individual campaigns
- Handles contributions and withdrawals
- Tracks funding progress
- Manages refunds if goals aren't met

### 3. Governance Token (`PlatformToken.sol`)

- ERC20 token for platform governance
- Used for voting on platform decisions
- Staking mechanisms for dispute resolution

### 4. Escrow Contract (`EscrowManager.sol`)

- Holds funds securely during campaign
- Releases funds based on campaign outcome
- Handles refunds when needed

## Workflow

### 1. Campaign Creation

1. Creator fills out form on frontend (title, description, goal amount, deadline, etc.)
2. Frontend calls `createCampaign()` on Factory contract
3. Factory deploys new Campaign contract instance
4. Campaign details are stored on-chain and indexed

### 2. Contribution Flow

1. Backer selects campaign and contribution amount on frontend
2. Frontend shows available payment options (ETH or approved ERC20s)
3. Backer approves token spending (if ERC20)
4. Frontend calls `contribute()` on Campaign contract
5. Funds are transferred to Escrow contract
6. Contribution is recorded with backer's address and amount

### 3. Campaign Completion

**Successful Campaign:**

1. After deadline, if goal met, creator can call `withdrawFunds()`
2. Escrow releases funds to creator (minus platform fee)
3. Rewards are distributed to backers based on tiers

**Failed Campaign:**

1. After deadline, if goal not met, backers can claim refunds
2. Backers call `claimRefund()` to get their contributions back
3. Escrow returns funds to each backer proportionally

### 4. Dispute Resolution

1. If creator fails to deliver, backers can initiate dispute
2. Dispute puts remaining funds in time-lock
3. Governance token holders vote on resolution
4. Based on vote, funds are either released to creator or returned to backers
